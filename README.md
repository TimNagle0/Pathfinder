Pathfinder: A gamified software tutorial
This project uses the unity engine to recreate parts of the Adobe Photoshop environment, to facilitate a gamified software tutorial about simple photoshop functionalities. To recreate the Photoshop environment, screenshots of different UI elements were used and the functionalities of different tools were recreated in Unity from scratch.

Currently the only tools that are supported by the game are the move and brush tool, as well as the Photoshop layer system.

For research purposes, the game uses the Bride of Frankensystem (BOFS) as a dependency to integrate data logging, custom webGL templates and online testing support.
